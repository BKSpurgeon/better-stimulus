# Better StimulusJS

## An Opinionated Collection of [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org/) Best Practices 

[StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org/), the _modest JavaScript framework_ by [Basecamp](https://www.basecamp.com) is gaining widespread traction. It powers Basecamp and [HEY](https://www.hey.com), among others, and is a natural choice for Rails developers. That said, it fits any codebase that embraces server-side generated HTML and lightweight JS sprinkles.

Unfortunately, the official docs lack clear guidelines and best practice examples. Thus, this guide tries to present advice for newcomers and intermediate Stimulus programmers.

### Who made this?
This site is maintained by [Julian Rubisch](https://github.com/julianrubisch), [Stimulus Reflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com) core team member and senior Rails developer. A range of [enthusiast volunteers](./contributors.md) helps keeping articles up to date and quality-assured.
